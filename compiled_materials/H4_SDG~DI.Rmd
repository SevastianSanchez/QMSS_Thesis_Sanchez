# SDG and DI Relationship
## Baseline Model [FOUND SOMETHING!!!]
Using fixed effects regression, how does a change in DI score impact SDG performance? Is the impact lagged or immediate?
```{r}
# baseline model
FE_all <- plm(formula = sdg_overall ~ di_score + dplyr::lag(di_score, 1) + dplyr::lag(di_score, 2) + log_gdppc + income_level_recoded,
              model = "within", 
              index = c("country_code", "year"),
              subset = stable == 1,
              data = panel_data, 
              effect = "twoways")
summary(FE_all)
summary(FE_all, vcov = vcovHC(FE_all, cluster = "group", type = "HC1"))
```

## Complete Regime Change (autocratized), Subgrouping [FOUND SOMETHING!!!]
Of countries that experienced complete change from democracy to autocracy (XX countries), how did the decrease in DI score impact their SDG performance? Was the impact lagged or immediate?
```{r}
# autocratized variable 
FE_aut <- plm(formula = sdg_overall ~ di_score + dplyr::lag(di_score, 1) + dplyr::lag(di_score, 2) + log_gdppc + income_level_recoded,
                  model = "within", 
                  index = c("country_code", "year"),
                  data = panel_data, 
                  subset = autocratized == 1, # modifying based regime stability
                  effect = "twoways")
summary(FE_aut)
summary(FE_aut, vcov = vcovHC(FE_aut, cluster = "group", type = "HC1"))
```

## Complete Regime Change (democratized), Subgrouping [FOUND SOMETHING!!!]
Of countries that experienced complete change from autocracy to democracy (XX countries), how did the decrease in DI score impact their SDG performance? Was the impact lagged or immediate?
```{r}
# autocratized variable 
FE_dem <- plm(formula = sdg_overall ~ di_score + dplyr::lag(di_score, 1) + dplyr::lag(di_score, 2) + log_gdppc + income_level_recoded,
                  model = "within", 
                  index = c("country_code", "year"),
                  data = panel_data, 
                  subset = democratized == 1, # modifying based on regime stability
                  effect = "twoways")
summary(FE_dem)
summary(FE_dem, vcov = vcovHC(FE_dem, cluster = "group", type = "HC1"))
```

## Complete Regime Change (autocratized), Subgrouping by **SDG GOAL**
Of countries that experienced complete change from democracy to autocracy (XX countries), how did the decrease in DI score impact their SDG *Goal X* performance? Was the impact lagged or immediate?
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
goal <- "goal1" # Change this to the specific goal you want to analyze

# autocratized variable 
FE_testing <- plm(formula = goal ~ di_score + dplyr::lag(di_score, 1) + dplyr::lag(di_score, 2) + log_gdppc + income_level_recoded,
                  model = "within", 
                  index = c("country_code", "year"),
                  data = panel_data, 
                  subset = autocratized == 1, # modifying based regime stability
                  effect = "twoways")
summary(FE_testing)
summary(FE_testing, vcov = vcovHC(FE_testing, cluster = "group", type = "HC1"))
```

## Put all three models in a table
```{r}
# Extracting robust standard errors for the three FE models
rob_se_fe <- list(
  coeftest(FE_all, vcov = vcovHC(FE_all, cluster = "group", type = "HC1"))[, 2],
