# COMPONENT 1: COMPARING SPI & SCI X VARIABLES

## Preliminary Analysis: Correlation & Naive OLS Models [FINALIZED]

### Correlation Analysis: SPI, SCI, DI & SDG Composite Scores
*H0: Null, there is no relationship*  
*H1: there is a relationship between overall SPI and SDG composite scores*

```{r}
# Correlation coefficients & R-squared values for SDG and SPI/SCI/DI

correlation_sdg_spi <- cor(merged$sdg_overall, merged$spi_comp, use = "complete.obs")
# R-squared value

# R-squared value

# pasting correlation results
paste("Correlation coefficient:" , correlation_sdg_spi, "(SDG ~ SPI),", correlation_sdg_sci, "(SDG ~ SCI),", correlation_sdg_di, "(SDG ~ DI),", correlation_spi_di, "(SPI ~ DI),", correlation_sci_di, "(SCI ~ DI)")

# pasting R-sq results
paste("R-squared value:", R2_sdg_spi, "(SDG ~ SPI),", R2_sdg_sci, "(SDG ~ SCI),", R2_sdg_di, "(SDG ~ DI),", R2_spi_di, "(SPI ~ DI),", R2_sci_di, "(SCI ~ DI)")
```
SDG ~ SPI: Correlation coefficient: 0.784880, R-squared value: 0.616037
SDG ~ SCI: Correlation coefficient: 0.646503, R-squared value: 0.417966
SDG ~ DI: Correlation coefficient: 0.672644, R-squared value: 0.452450
SPI ~ DI: Correlation coefficient: 0.676171, R-squared value: 0.4572067
SCI ~ DI: Correlation coefficient: 0.477767, R-squared value: 0.2282613

The results demonstrates that SDG performance (SDG) composite scores are most strongly associated with the Statistical Performance Index (SPI), which shows a high correlation coefficient (0.78) and explains about 62% of the variance in SDG scores. Both the Statistical Capacity Index (SCI) and the Democracy Index (DI) also exhibit moderate positive correlations with SDG scores (0.65 and 0.67, respectively), accounting for 42% and 45% of the variance. This could indicate that countries with higher statistical performance and stronger democratic institutions tend to achieve better SDG outcomes, with SPI emerging as the most influential predictor among the indices examined.

Both SPI and SCI are also positively correlated with the Democracy Index, with SPI (0.68) showing a stronger association than SCI (0.48). These findings highlight the interconnectedness of statistical capacity and governance quality, suggesting that improvements in national statistical systems and democratic governance are mutually reinforcing factors in advancing sustainable development.

**The correlation analysis provides a useful overview of the relationships between these indices, but further analysis is needed to understand the causal mechanisms and the impact of these indices on SDG outcomes.**

# 2. OLS for SCI and SDG - Overall

  digits = 4,
  type = "text" 
  #out = "component_1/figures/naive_mods_sdgs_spi_sci_tab.html"  # Save as HTML file
)

```
ols_spi_naive: 0.47806 (p-value < 0.01)  
ols_sci_naive: 0.39081 (p-value < 0.01)  
ols_multiple_naive: spi: 0.28779 (p-value < 0.01); 
                    sci: 0.15311 (p-value < 0.01)

The impact of SCI on SDG and SPI on SDG are statistically significant, in all models. SPI appears to have a greater impact on SDGs compared to that of SCI, regardless of the model. All of this is without controls or accounting multiple time periods of the same subject (i.e., countries).

### NAIVE OLS Models (Component 2): DI variable on SPI & SDG Performance

# 2. OLS for SDG and DI - Overall

```
*results*
ols_spi_di_naive: 5.0122 (p-value < 0.001)
ols_sdg_di_naive: 3.22301 (p-value < 0.001)

The naive OLS models indicate that the Democracy Index (DI) has a strong positive relationship with both the Statistical Performance Index (SPI) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) composite scores. The coefficients suggest that a one-unit increase in DI is associated with a 5.0122 increase in SPI and a 3.22301 increase in SDG scores, both statistically significant at p < 0.001. This suggests that countries with higher democracy scores tend to have better statistical performance and SDG outcomes.

### Checking for Heteroskedasticity: residual plots [no need to report]

plot(ols_spi_di_naive, which = 1)  # SPI ~ DI model 
plot(ols_sdg_di_naive, which = 1)  # SDG ~ DI model 

# U-shaped residuals detected, suggests non-linearity of x-variable terms. Additional tests reconfirm non-linearity (See Breusch-Pagan Test below).

## TEST 1: Pooled OLS & Clustered Robust Standard Errors -- COMPARING MEASURES [DONE]

*Methodology: Pooled OLS Models & Clustered Robust (Huber-White) Standard Errors*
All variables of statistical capacity (SPI & SCI) will be compared on a base pooled OLS regression model structure. Pooled OLS recognizes the panel-like structure allowing to index by specific country and year (country-year). Regular OLS, assumes independence of observations which is not suitable given the repeated waves of country-year over the course of multiple consecutive years. Furthermore, it is customary to apply clustered-group robust standard errors to account for heteroskedasticity and within-unit correlation of countries over many time points. 

*H0: Null, there is no relationship between SPI and SDG composite scores*
*H1: There is a statistically significant relationship between SPI and SDG composite scores*

``` 

**Results:**
The results of the OLS models with robust standard errors indicate that both SPI and SCI have a statistically significant positive relationship with SDG composite scores. The p-values for both SPI and SCI are less than 0.001, indicating strong evidence against the null hypothesis of no relationship for either model. Holding all else constant (log GDP per capita, democracy score and year), SPI and SCI exhibit positive moderate and statistically significant relationships with SDG status.

ols_spi: 0.28735 (p-value < 0.001)*** 
ols_sci: 0.237633 (p-value < 0.001)*** 
ols_multiple: 
  spi: 0.124233 (p-value < 0.05)*
  sci: 0.138766 (p-value < 0.01)**

When compared in separate models, SPI has a greater impact on SDG status (0.28735) than SCI (0.237633). This suggests that a one-unit increase in SPI is associated with a larger improvement in SDG outcomes compared to a one-unit increase in SCI, holding all controls constant. 

Interestingly, the opposite holds true in a multiple regression model containing both SPI and SCI. SPI's impact on SDG status (0.124233) (net of SPI) is less than that of SCI's (0.138766) (net of SCI), holding all controls constant. When together, the coefficients represent the unique impact of each predictor variable (measures of statistical capacity) on SDG status, net of all other variables.

Model 1 (ols_spi) does not control for SCI and model 2 (ols_sci) does not control for spi -- this is okay. SPI is the predecessor of the SCI, sharing/data overlap, and so it is expected to have significant statistical correlation (multicollinearity). This is possibly what explains the reduction of both regression coefficients in model 3: 0.28735 to 0.124233 for SPI (__% decrease); and from 0.237633 to 0.138766 for SCI (__% decrease). This indicates that both variables capture much of the same underlying relationship with SDG performance.

However, the fact that both SPI and SCI remain significant when included together (model 3), although SCI less so than SPI, with a high adjusted R-sq (0.741525), which suggests they capture different dimensions of statistical capacity that independently contribute to SDG status.

### Checking for Multicolinearity: VIF of SPI & SCI [DONE]
```{r}
# Checking correlation between SPI and SCI
cor(merged$spi_comp, merged$sci_overall, use = "complete.obs")

# Checking VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) in Model 3
vif(ols_multiple)

# Datatable 
vif_vals <- vif(ols_multiple)   # returns a named vector
tidy_vif <- enframe(vif_vals, name = "term", value = "vif")

print(tidy_vif)

#write.csv(tidy_vif, file = "component_1/figures/vif_results.csv")
```

**Colinearity:** The correlation between SCI and SPI is about 0.8277. When placed within the same model, SCI inflated the standard error of SPI from 0.013079 to 0.027054. SCI had a similar reaction from the SPI with its standard error increasing from 0.0095864 to 0.024096.

**VIF:** Such multicollinearity is moderately reflected in the VIF test which accounts for all x variables in the model instead of just the two measures of statistical capacity (SCI & SPI).

_VIF Results:_
  term          vif    Df    GVIF^(1/(2*Df))
spi_comp     4.316894  1        2.077714
sci_overall  3.754613  1        1.937682
di_score     1.598314  1        1.264244
log_gdppc    1.485085  1        1.218641
factor(year) 1.302733  4        1.033611 

Overall there reveals no severe multicollinearity (all GVIF < 5). There is moderate correlation between statistical capacity measures (spi_comp and sci_overall) with SPI moderately inflated by a factor of 4.32 and SCI inflated by a factor of  3.75. Nevertheless, it is acceptable to include both in the same model as doing so will not severely impact estimates with both factors less than 5.0. Even so, there are significant limitations in either model that warrant strong consideration, including sample size, and longitudinal suitability. All other variables show minimal multicollinearity concerns.

### Checking for Heteroskedasticity: Breusch-Pagan Test [DONE]
This validates the need for integrating robust standard errors in our models
```{r}
# Breusch-Pagan Test for Heteroskedasticity
bp_spi <- bptest(ols_spi) # in objects for presentability 
bp_sci <- bptest(ols_sci)
bp_multiple <- bptest(ols_multiple)

# combine for data frame 
bp_tests <- list(
  ols_spi = bp_spi,
  ols_sci = bp_sci,
  ols_multiple = bp_multiple
)

# Tidy all tests and add a "model" column
bptests_results <- bp_tests %>% 
  map_df(~ tidy(.x), .id = "model")

print(bptests_results)

#write.csv(bptests_results, file = "component_1/figures/bp_heterosked_results.csv")
```
Model:         BP statistic      p-value
ols_spi           207.         = 7.05e-39       
ols_sci           86.6         = 4.22e-12
ols_multiple      31.1         = 1.33e- 4 

The Breusch-Pagan Test was applied to test to see whether residuals are constant across observations, which signals unaccounted non-linear relationships, especially with macro factors such as GDP Per Capita and Population in the models. This is important because Ordinary Least Squares models assume constant error variance. In such a complex world of diverse cultural and ever-changing political structures across almost 200 countries, cross-national data, especially in development, is rarely ever linear. Accordingly, this test evaluates the extent of such non-linearity among specified predictors. 

As such, results indicate strong evidence of heteroskedasticity in all three models. The small p-values in all models indicates that the variance of residuals are not constant across observations in all three models. This reinforces the motivation behind applying robust standard errors, which have been integrated to all OLS models. Without Robust SEs, there is a risk of inflated t-statistics, leading to false significance and misinterpretation of results.

Despite the improvement from 206.5 (SPI) and 86.6 (SCI) to 31.1 (Both), there still remains statically significant heteroskedasticity in the combined model. Both statistical capacity measures create a better-specified model (ols_multiple), though not enough to eliminate heteroskedasticity entirely.

### Missing Data Structure & Interpretations [DONE]
**Systematic, non-random missing data pattern:** SPI has near complete country data coverage (165 out of 168 countries with an SDG score), but with a stubborn temporal limitation (2016-2023). On the other hand, SCI has longer temporal coverage (2004-2020) but lacks reporting on high-income countries focusing primarily on the developing world (123 out of 168 countries with an SDG score).

To determine which predictor (i.e., SPI or SCI) is stronger –also considering if they’re stronger together (ols_multiple)– this investigation considers (a) descriptive statistics (i.e., number of observations); (b) adjusted R2 estimates; and (c) AIC/BIC model scores. These measures are compared across models that sustain the same controls, however, statistical checks are weighted against frequency of observations, given anticipated differences in the number of years and mis-alignment of particular start to end year periods. 

### Visual Analysis of Fit: SCI & SPI x SDG
```{r echo=FALSE}
#define regression line colors
spi_line <- "steelblue4"
sci_line <- "darkgoldenrod"

# Creating scatterplot with both SPI and SCI on the same plot
Compare_fit <- ggplot(merged, aes(x = spi_comp, y = sdg_overall))+
  geom_smooth(aes(x = spi_comp, y = sdg_overall), 
              color = spi_line, 
              method = "lm", 
              linewidth = 0.75, 
              se = FALSE)+ # Regression line SPI
  geom_smooth(aes(x = sci_overall, y = sdg_overall), 
              color = sci_line, 
              method = "lm", 
              linewidth = 0.75, 
              se = FALSE)+ # Regression line for SCI
  geom_point(aes(color = "spi_comp"), alpha=0.50, size = 0.5)+ # Scatter plot for SPI
  geom_point(aes(x = sci_overall, y = sdg_overall, color = "sci_overall"), 
             alpha=0.5, size = 0.5)+ # Add SCI points w/different color
  scale_color_manual(values = c("spi_comp" = "steelblue2", 
                                "sci_overall" = "darkgoldenrod2")) +
  labs(title = "Comparing SPI & SCI Measures Against SDG Index",
       x = "SPI & SCI Scores (0-100)",
       y = "SDG Composite (0-100)",
       color = "Measure:"
       ) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 12)) + # size for both axis titles
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.box = "horizontal",
        legend.title = element_text(size = 10), # size for legend title 
        legend.text = element_text(size = 10), # size for both legend lables
        plot.title = element_text(hjust= 0.4, size = 12, face = "bold")) # title size and position

# Print the plot
Compare_fit

# Save to specific folder
#ggsave("component_1/figures/spi&sci_scatterplot.png", Compare_fit, width = 8, height = 6)
```

*Note* The SPI regression line is expected to appear higher in terms of SDG Score compared the SCI model because SPI countries include higher-income countries. As previously mentioned, the SCI soley focuses on lower to upper-middle income countries (146 countries over 17 years).
